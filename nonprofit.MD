## Notes
- The **Indirect Method** starts with the Change in Net Assets from the Statement of Activities, adjusting for non-cash items (e.g., Depreciation) and changes in working capital accounts (e.g., Pledges Receivable, Grants Receivable) from the nonprofit COA.
- The **Direct Method** lists cash inflows from contributions, grants, and program fees, and outflows for functional expenses (Program Services, Management & General, Fundraising).
- **Investing Activities** include cash flows from long-term assets and contributions restricted for capital assets or endowments, reflecting nonprofit-specific COA accounts.
- **Financing Activities** focus on debt and permanent endowment contributions, excluding equity-related transactions typical in for-profit entities.
- The **Net Change in Cash** is the sum of cash flows from all three activities, reconciling the Beginning and Ending Cash Balances on the Statement of Financial Position.
- Amounts ([Amount], [Total]) should be populated with data from the nonprofitâ€™s financial records and COA balances.
