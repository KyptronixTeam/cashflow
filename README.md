## Notes

- The **Indirect Method** starts with Net Income and adjusts for non-cash items (e.g., Depreciation, Amortization) and changes in working capital accounts (e.g., Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Accounts Payable) from the COA.
- The **Direct Method** directly lists cash inflows (e.g., Cash collected from Customers) and outflows (e.g., Cash paid to Suppliers) related to core operations, also derived from COA accounts.
- **Investing Activities** reflect changes in Non-Current Asset accounts (e.g., Property, Plant, & Equipment, Investments) from the COA, with purchases as outflows and sales as inflows.
- **Financing Activities** involve changes in Non-Current Liability (e.g., Bonds Payable) and Equity accounts (e.g., Common Stock, Retained Earnings) from the COA.
- The **Net Change in Cash** is the sum of cash flows from Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities, reconciling the Beginning and Ending Cash Balances on the Balance Sheet.
- Specific amounts (\[Amount\], \[Total\]) should be populated with data from the companyâ€™s financial records and COA balances.
